Mentoring is a relationship. In short, mentoring is a relationship between two individuals of different levels of experience, one senior and one junior in experience, that focuses on advancing professional and personal development. Mentoring is about information sharing and learning through and with another person. From Professor Dumbledore and Harry Potter to Socrates and Plato to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, it is clear mentoring relationships come in all shapes and sizes. Individual differences make no two mentoring relationships alike, but are all based on mutual trust, respect, and integrity. 1.2 Background The Montclair State University Industrial and Organizational Psychology Graduate Program is proud to offer a Student Mentor Program for students in their first year of graduate school. Incoming students are matched with a mentor who can provide extracurricular support and share first-hand knowledge about the I.O profession. Incoming Masters students will be matched with either a returning Masters or Ph.D. student, and incoming Ph.D. students will only be paired with a returning Ph.D. student. Mentor and mentee pairings are then made based upon mutual interests in I.O psychology. 1.3 Mission Statement Our mentor program is dedicated to creating an environment that fosters growth, development, and engagement of first year I.O students to become successful academically, professionally, and socially during graduate school.

Support may be provided in structured forms such as in summer bridge programs [and] mentor programs. (Tinto 2003) After one year of mentoring by faculty, students with mentors have higher GPAs and are more likely to stay in college compared to students who do not have mentors. (Campbell and Campbell 1997) Mentoring increased students GPA, mentored students failed fewer courses, and mentored students were much more likely to be in good academic standing after one year of college than non-mentored students (88.5% vs. 57.1%). (Salinitri 2005) Mentored first year students are significantly more likely to return to college for a second year. (Terenzini, Pascarella, and Blimling 1996) Having a mentor in college helps students with identity formation, coping skills, stress reduction, and persistence to graduation. (Bordes and Arredondo 2005) Mentored minority college students are twice as likely to persist as non-mentored minority students. They also have higher GPAs than nonmentored students. (Crisp and Cruz 2009) Formal and informal mentoring programs are conducive to the transition, retention, and success of minority students in higher education.  Students who participate are much more satisfied with their college experience than those who did not participate in mentoring programs.  Establishing multiple levels of mentoring programsfaculty, peers, staff, and administratorsis important in providing success mechanisms for minority students.
