\chapter{Mentoring Overview}\label{mentoring-overview}}

\hypertarget{history-definition}{%
\section{History \& Definition}\label{history-definition}}

The meaning of the word ``Mentor'' has evolved to describe a person that facilitates personal and professional growth in an individual by sharing knowledge and insight that have been learned through the years. Mentoring is a relationship. In short, mentoring is a relationship between two individuals of different levels of experience, one senior and one junior in experience, that focuses on advancing professional and personal development. Mentoring is about information sharing and learning through and with another person. From Professor Dumbledore and Harry Potter to Socrates and Plato to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker, it is clear mentoring relationships come in all shapes and sizes. Individual differences make no two mentoring relationships alike, but are all based on mutual trust, respect, and integrity.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

The Montclair State University Industrial and Organizational Psychology Graduate Program is proud to offer a Student Mentor Program for students in their first year of graduate school. Incoming students are matched with a mentor who can provide extracurricular support and share first-hand knowledge about the I.O profession. Incoming Masters students will be matched with either a returning Master's or Ph.D.~student, and incoming Ph.D.~students will only be paired with a returning Ph.D.~student. Mentor and mentee pairings are then made based upon mutual interests in I.O psychology.

\hypertarget{mission-statement}{%
\section{Mission Statement}\label{mission-statement}}

Our mentor program is dedicated to creating an environment that fosters growth, development, and engagement of first year I.O students to become successful academically, professionally, and socially during graduate school.

\hypertarget{benefits-for-mentees}{%
\section{Benefits for Mentees}\label{benefits-for-mentees}}

Working with a mentor can be an advantage for an incoming student. Mentees gain valuable experience by forging one-on-one relationships with current I.O graduate students. These experiences include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Help with setting realistic goals.
\item
  Strengthening knowledge of the industry, organizational culture, and job functions.
\item
  Expanding your existing network and support system.
\item
  Receiving feedback from an experienced student.
\item
  Enhancing overall professional effectiveness.
\item
  Gaining knowledge and experience to be a future mentor.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{benefits-for-mentors}{%
\section{Benefits for Mentors}\label{benefits-for-mentors}}

Contributing time and expertise as a mentor is a valuable way to give back and foster the next generation of MSU I.O Psychology graduate students. Mentoring can be both personally and professionally rewarding, as mentors learn the value in helping their peers succeed. Some benefits of being a mentor include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Build leadership skills.
\item
  Build communication skills.
\item
  Expand professional network and increase visibility.
\item
  Contribute to the advancement of the profession.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{responsibilities}{%
\chapter{Responsibilities}\label{responsibilities}}

\includegraphics{images/responsibility.jpg}

The key to success for students is to commit time and effort toward developing their future careers by taking full advantage of this unique opportunity. Mentees should supply their mentor with feedback and be open to receiving advice and coaching from the mentor.

  After one year of mentoring by faculty, students with mentors have higher GPAs and are more likely to stay in college compared to students who do not have mentors. \citep{campbell_faculty/student_1997}
\item
  Mentoring increased students' GPA, mentored students failed fewer courses, and mentored students were much more likely to be in good academic standing after one year of college than non-mentored students (88.5\% vs.~57.1\%). \citep{salinitri_effects_2005}
\item
  Mentored first year students are significantly more likely to return to college for a second year. \citep{terenzini_students_1996}
\item
  Having a mentor in college helps students with identity formation, coping skills, stress reduction, and persistence to graduation. \citep{bordes_mentoring_2005}
\item
  Mentored minority college students are twice as likely to persist as non-mentored minority students. They also have higher GPAs than non---mentored students. \citep{crisp_mentoring_2009}
\item
  Formal and informal mentoring programs are conducive to the transition, retention, and success of minority students in higher education. • Students who participate are much more satisfied with their college experience than those who did not participate in mentoring programs. • Establishing multiple levels of mentoring programs------faculty, peers, staff, and administrators------is important in providing success mechanisms for minority students. \citep{pope_community_2002}

  Having a mentor in college helps students with identity formation, coping skills, stress reduction, and persistence to graduation. \citep{bordes_mentoring_2005}
