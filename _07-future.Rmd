## Mission Statement

## Program

1) Students who have already taken the fall classes can be mentors
2) Mentors have to go through a “training” (review developed handbook)
3) Must have a certain GPA (3.0)
4) Sending out blast email to program each semester
5) Provide bio? **(maybe this part shouldnt be part of the handbook, but a nice addition to the active program)**
    + Undergraduate degree: 
    + I/O interests

    + After graduation: Anything else
